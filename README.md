# Machine_Learning_for_characterizing_fly_behavior
Currently in progress.
This is the working repository for my master thesis project, where I am trying to classify how flies behave in a free-flying setup which is developed in the NFC group of MPINB, Bonn. The project is in progress at the moment. The goal is to characterize different flight behaviors in the presence of a looming stimulus using machine learning algorithm.
